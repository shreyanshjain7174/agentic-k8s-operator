# Agentic Kubernetes Operator

**Enterprise-grade Kubernetes operator for autonomous agent orchestration**

Built on the research foundations of "Agentic Consensus: Multi-Agent Consensus on Kubernetes Operator Proposals" (2026).

## Vision

Enable safe, consensus-driven deployment of Kubernetes operators through multi-agent deliberation, validation, and execution.

## Architecture

- **LangGraph Swarm**: Multi-agent consensus system (PM, Architect, Engineer, QA, Security agents)
- **Operator Framework**: Kubebuilder v4-based Kubernetes operator
- **PostgreSQL State**: Persistent proposal tracking and agent memory
- **GitHub Integration**: Automated PR creation and review workflows

## Status

🚧 **Active Development** - Autonomous development system deploying Phase 1 (MVP)

## Project Phases

**Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4)**: Core consensus engine + basic operator
**Phase 2 (Weeks 5-8)**: Security hardening + multi-cluster
**Phase 3 (Weeks 9-12)**: Production deployment + monitoring

## Research Paper

Based on "Agentic Consensus: Multi-Agent Consensus on Kubernetes Operator Proposals"
